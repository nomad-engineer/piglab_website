Our goal is to produce something useful as quickly as possible with minimal intrusive and costly alterations. We appreciate that the plant may may be fundamentally flawed either due to poor design or changes to requirements after it was built. Either way we understand that budget and time is limited and we have to work with what we have. In our experience we have found that most problems can be solved with a few minor software changes and operational tweaks so this is where we aim to start before suggesting aggressive physical changes. Our workflow looks like this:

1. **Site visit:** Perform a detailed walk though of the plant following whatever documentation is easily accessible. Spend time with experienced operators and engineers to access equipment condition, what works, what doesn't, how others believe problems can be fixed.
2. **Manual Effort:** Spend time operating the plant getting to know it and try to get it working better. This could involve very manual, tedious, high effort and unsustainable operation of the plant but will help identify what changes could be made.
3. **Data Collection:** Where lacking install instruments to collect diagnostic information. This could be a simple as pointing a camera at a hopper, adding extra instruments into existing control and SCADA systems or temporary data logging systems and devising operator data collection plans to manually gather data.
4. **Automate the Manual:** We have found it is often more effective to start with the 'sledgehammer' approach and brute force the plant into operation. Start by doing things manually to see if it works then adding automation to take workload off of personnel. Traditional engineering firms tend to produce detailed engineering plans based on assumptions that the changes will work. We prefer to gain confidence in solutions before committing resources into something that might not work.
5. **Make Good:** After an intensive period of changes to control panels, software and hardware we will recommend what needs to be done to 'make the plant good' including: Tiding electrical installations, capturing changes in document revisions, organising software versions, extra spare parts to order and otherwise ensure the plant and its documentation is ready for others to work on in the future.
